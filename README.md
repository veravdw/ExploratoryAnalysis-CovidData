# Covid Data Analysis - South Korea

South Korea has been seen as an exemplar country in their covid-19 approach. The role of local governments has been especially praised (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9349588/). This project is an exploratory analysis into the covid development in South Korea, over the first 6 months of 2020, aiming to get insights into why their approach was effective.  

## Format

The analysis is performed in a Jupyter notebook, and can be opened in any IDE that supports Jupyter notebook files (.ipynb).

## Dataset Description

The data for this analysis is coming from the kaggle website, to be found via this url: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kimjihoo/coronavirusdataset. The data consists of a set of csv's, some containing aggregated data and others single case data, most of them including date range data from January to June 2020, the beginning of the pandemic. 
Datasets contain data about:

* Overall confirmed cases, deaths, tests, recovered cases over time
* Confirmed cases and deaths by gender, age group and province
* Hospitalised patient data 
* Causes of infections, group causes and individual
* Policy data
* Population movement data

In this analysis we look at patterns in covid case development and policy implementation, in order to identify how quickly covid measures came into place, how many over time, and what might have been the triggers to increase or decrease.
